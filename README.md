# UCAS_Project_EvolutionaryComputation
This project is a large assignment for the fall semester 2023 at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences - Evolutionary Computation: Acrobot Robot Pendulum Control

A fuzzy controller based on SEGA, APSO, and reinforcement learning for SAC is implemented to control the Acrobot Robot.

requirements:
gym = 0.23.0
stable-baseline3 = 2.1.0
geatpy = 2.7

For fuzzy control and RL control which require separate modifications to the original 'gym' environment, we provide two modified environments in the folder 'Environments'.

Details can be found in the pdf file of the report.

Thanks to my teammates:  Yaocheng Zhangï¼Œ Kaixuan Xu and  Wei Bao.
